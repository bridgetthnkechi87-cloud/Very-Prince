# Smart Contract API Reference

The core logic of the **Very-Prince** payout infrastructure is implemented as a Soroban smart contract in Rust. The contract manages organization registration, public budgets, maintainer enrollment, and payout allocations with built-in multisig security controls and protocol pause features.

---

## Data Types

### `Organization`
Represents a registered organization.
```rust
pub struct Organization {
    pub id: Symbol,
    pub name: String,
    pub admins: Vec<Address>,
    pub metadata_cid: Option<String>,
}
```

### `Maintainer`
Represents a maintainer enrolled under an organization.
```rust
pub struct Maintainer {
    pub address: Address,
    pub org_id: Symbol,
}
```

### `PayoutParams`
Represents a payout entry used in batch allocation.
```rust
pub struct PayoutParams {
    pub maintainer: Address,
    pub amount: i128,
}
```

### `MaintainerPayout`
Represents the claimable balance and unlock timestamp for a maintainer.
```rust
pub struct MaintainerPayout {
    pub amount: i128,
    pub unlock_timestamp: u64,
}
```

### `ProtocolState`
Represents the global state of the protocol.
```rust
pub enum ProtocolState {
    Active,
    Paused,
}
```
